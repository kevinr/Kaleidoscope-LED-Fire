# Kaleidoscope-LED-Fire

The `FireEffect` plugin makes flames that roar from the bottom of your keyboard
and every keypress.

## Using the plugin

To use the plugin, one needs to include the header and select the effect.

```c++
#include <Kaleidoscope.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-LED-Fire.h>

void setup (){
  Kaleidoscope.use(&FireEffect);

  Kaleidoscope.setup();

  FireEffect.activate();
}
```

It is recommended to place the activation of the plugin (the `USE_PLUGINS` call)
as early as possible, so the plugin can catch all relevant key presses.

## Acknowledgments

The `FireEffect` plugin is based on [Selene Scriven](https://github.com/ToyKeeper/)'s 
excellent [`WavePoolEffect` plugin](https://github.com/ToyKeeper/Kaleidoscope-LED-Wavepool/),
without which I likely would never have succeeded.

It implements a simplified version of the [classic demoscene fire effect as documented by Lode][fire].

Oldsters like me may recall Javier "Jare" Ar√©valo's classic [firedemo][firedemo] from 1993 (which he recently [ported to HTML5][firedemo-html5]).  Hans Wennborg has written a [nice walkthrough of it][firedemo-walkthrough].
